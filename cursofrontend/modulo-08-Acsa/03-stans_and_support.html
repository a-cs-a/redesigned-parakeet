      <h1> Stans and Support</h1>
      <p> These are from now on your masters. You will pledge alliance to their flag. For them you will declare and wage war and unleash a thousand years of pain unto their enemies or antis - JUST KIDDING!- </p>

      <h2> What is a Stan?</h2>
      <p> Now that we covered the basics of the stan twitter universe, it's time to go a little deeper into some stan water. It goes unsaid that as individual with multiple tastes, you absolutly can be into multiple fandoms. But like the mere human being that you are, obviously you're going to have a favorite thing amongst the favorite things that you have, the thing tha you focus the most. Now, 'stan' is reserved to be used more commonly to refer to people: artists, musicians, celebrities, actors and even ficctional characters. Your object of obssesion amongst these are your 'stans'</p>

      <h2> What is a Support?</h2>
      <p> Now that you know what a stan is, a support is the other side of the coin, it's what you like, what's inside the big umbrella of all the things that you like</p>

      <h2> A short introduction to Cards:</h2>
      <p> What is a card? You might ask. Well my newbbie friend, a card is your 'business card', to put it that way. You build you card, with a pretty design and all, listing all the thing the you like - or the thing that you are willingly to share - the things that you dislike, you specify what you look for in commonn moot, and what you're trying to avoid in future conversations. Neat trick, huh?</p>
