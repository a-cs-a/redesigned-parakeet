  <h1> Stan Twitter</h1>
  <p> Welcome to the devil's lair. Sit tight. Grab a blanket. Get cozy. It's going to be a wild ride!.</p>

  

  <h2> What is Stan Twitter?</h2>
  <p> You must be wondering, "what the heck is stan twitter?". Well my friend, look no further, here you're about to find out what it is and how it works.</p>
  <p> First of all the main difference between stan twitter and...well twitter is that on stan twitter you basically devote your whole time - not kidding! - to things that you are into. Be it: games; sport teams; musicians; musical bands or groups; actors; tv shows; celebrities of all sorts; and more recently aesthetics and moods; your "pack" (profile picture and header) is in style with the subject of your adoration</p>
  <p> And it's not to say that on regular twitter you don't devote your whole time reciting the tales of your day-to-day life, with WAY TOO MUCH details, also to share your interests and passion. It's just that on stan twitter you see a broader network - really!- of people that share multiples interests in commonn and this social media allows theem to keep track of each other. I KNOW it's not a new concept, but i'm just explaining the way it is, don'st ask further questions about it.</p>

  <h2> How does it work</h2>
  <p> At this point i must imagine that you already got the gist of the whole affair. The magical thing about social media is that you can be literally whoever you want to be - in terms of reiveinting oneself and freeing your thoughts and your artistic side, i'm not enabling criminal activities here! - So at certain degree it is quite normal for a person to have more than one page of the same social media.</p>
  <p> And in this case, a person can have an account for their stan activities and their more private lives, one that is more reserved and even "locked". But how does it work? Well, it's quite simple to be honest. You create an account, you style it to the topic that you are passionate about and just...interact with people. The algorithm will display for you topics and subjects about the stuff that you like and that's pretty much it. The world is your oyester now! Go have fun! But not too much, deal?</p>
