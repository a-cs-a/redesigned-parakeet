      <h1> Squads</h1>
      <p> Your main bitches. Ride or die - quite literally - But they also can cancel you. Weird power dynamics, i know.</p>
      <h2>What is a Squad</h2>
      <p> I am going to assume that you are a very educated person on any piece of media ever realized after the 80's. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT A SQUAD IS! But if you don't that's fine, that is why i'sm here. Squad is group of people that your form a bond, and as we speak of stan twitter/fandoms etc et all, your squad most likely you be of people that you'll meet over your time on social media. And you know the whole troupe: friendship to found family and the whole hurrah.</p>

      <h2> The difference between 'Gram Squad and Twitter Squad</h2>
      <p>To be honest, i can't say with certainty what IS the difference. But there is one, i'm sure of it!. Maybe it's because on the Instagram appearances are the currency: The pictures, the makeups, the likes, the right poses, the right angle, the oppulence of it all. Whereas on twitter, people are UNHINGEDT!The most wild thoughts and comments are the normalcy of the site, and - don't be shocked - you will find that people can relate to the most bizarre of things. So if you are looking for autencity - i think we can put it this way - twitter is your way. But everything that shines isn't gold.</p>
