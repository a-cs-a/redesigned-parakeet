      <h1> Fandoms</h1>

      <h2> What is a Fandom?</h2>
      <p> Well, this far i believe the meaning of a fandom is pretty much established, but let's dive a little bit more into it. A fandom is the fanbase of something or someone, quaint isn't it?.</p>

      <h2> Am i part of a fandom?</h2>
      <p> The question of ages, am i right? Now nobody, really, you give you a test and a badge saying "Now you're part of this fandom". Do you like something? Certain artist? Certain tv show? Then yes, you're part of a fandom. That easy.</p>

      <h2> How to engage in a fandom?</h2>
      <p> Once again, i believe it's already established. You create an account. You style this account to your likeness and the likeness of the thing or someone that you like. And then twitter will bring the right people - or not - to you, after that you'll simply have to talk to people, with the utmost care, it goes unsaid, of course, you never know who's the other side of the screen.</p>
